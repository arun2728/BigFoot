## Objective

* To provide a perfect place for students to become a successful data analysist
* To provide a platform where one can access all information related to data science at one place

## Services 

#### Concepts :

* Data science : It is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data.
* ML Algorithms : Machine Learning algorithm is an evolution of the regular algorithm. It makes your programs “smarter”, by allowing them to automatically learn from the data you provide
#### ML Datasets : 
A data set (or dataset) is a collection of data. In the case of tabular data, a data set corresponds to one or more database tables, where every column of a table represents a particular variable, and each row corresponds to a given record of the data set in question.

#### ML Models : 
Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience
Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as “training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. 


## Technologies used

* HTML5 : To develop static websites
* CSS3 : To add font properties, colors, text alignments, graphics, background images, tables and other components
* JS : To send email feature
* JQuery : The purpose of jQuery is to provide validation
* Python : Used for building ML models and deploying them(flask)
